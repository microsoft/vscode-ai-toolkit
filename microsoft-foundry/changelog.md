# Microsoft Foundry Canvas Changelog

Notable changes to the Microsoft Foundry Canvas plugin for GitHub Copilot App.

## Version 1.0.12

This release gives you more control over Chat and Canvas workflows, refines Hosted Agent validation, and improves sign-in, project selection, and Agent Inspector reliability.

### Added

- **Hosted Agent validation**: The plugin now includes the validation adapter skill and a welcome screen for validation reports.

### Changed

- **Chat and Canvas workflows**: Choose Chat/CLI or Canvas for supported existing-agent operations when no preference is set. Your explicit choice stays active throughout the conversation until you change it.
- **Foundry skill**: Skill synchronization now runs in the background without delaying Canvas prompts or agent creation.
- **Hosted Agent validation**: Successful reports are easier to identify, and **Fix with Copilot** requests include only findings that require action.

### Fixed

- **Project selection**: The selected Foundry project remains unchanged during discovery refreshes, and stale selection updates are ignored.
- **Sign-in**: Subscriptions and projects load only after sign-in is confirmed. Subscriptions refresh after sign-in, and stale discovery responses no longer overwrite the current state.
- **Agent Inspector input**: The message input remains usable on macOS when native scrollbars are enabled. Related: [#740](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/740).
- **Agent Inspector connections**: Connection health checks and recovery are more reliable, and startup timeout messages clear after the agent reconnects. Related: [#741](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/741).
- **Agent Inspector theme**: The embedded Inspector now follows the host's light or dark theme. Related: [#743](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/743).

## Version 1.0.11

This release adds clearer validation reports and Copilot fix actions, keeps troubleshooting in Chat, and improves local inspection.

### Changed

- **Hosted Agent validation**: Reports now have status tabs, expandable findings, responsive layouts, and individual or bulk **Fix with Copilot** actions.
- **Chat and Canvas workflows**: Troubleshooting, code reviews, planning, informational questions, and mixed fix-and-deploy requests stay in Chat instead of opening Canvas unexpectedly.
- **Local inspection**: The integrated terminal stays visible while the agent starts so launch errors remain accessible.

### Fixed

- **Agent Inspector**: Copy and download actions now work in the embedded Inspector, and the back icon is correctly aligned.

## Version 1.0.10

This release introduces Hosted Agent best-practice validation and shows agent-creation progress in Canvas.

### Added

- **Hosted Agent validation**: Review Hosted Agent best-practice findings in a dedicated validation report Canvas.
- **Agent creation**: Canvas now opens while Copilot creates an agent from a concrete request and shows creation progress. Editing stays unavailable while Copilot is working, while sign-in remains accessible.

### Fixed

- **Foundry skill**: Skill updates now run one at a time to prevent overlapping installations.
- **Plugin updates**: Update guidance now points to **Customize > Installed > Plugins**.

## Version 1.0.9

This release improves Azure Developer CLI detection after installation.

### Fixed

- **Azure Developer CLI**: Canvas now refreshes `azd` detection after installation instead of continuing to report that the CLI is unavailable. Related: [#708](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/708).

## Version 1.0.8

This release streamlines agent creation and management, adds Azure Developer CLI installation guidance, and improves theme readability and skill updates.

### Added

- **Azure Developer CLI**: Use **Install azd** guidance when the CLI is unavailable.

### Changed

- **Agent creation**: Concrete creation requests no longer require a second submission through **Start**. Guided creation remains available for requests without a concrete purpose. Related: [#694](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/694).
- **Agent management**: Supported existing-agent configuration and redeployment workflows now open Canvas in management mode. Related: [#695](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/695).
- **Themes**: Controls have clearer contrast, selected states, and readability in light and dark themes. Related: [#717](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/717).
- **Foundry skill**: Installation and updates now use stable Azure Skills releases instead of the moving source branch. Related: [#703](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/703).
- **Canvas client**: The client now uses React and TypeScript.
- **Repository links**: References now point to Foundry Dev Tools.

### Fixed

- **Canvas actions**: Canvas-generated actions no longer loop back through Canvas routing or stay blocked after Copilot becomes idle.
- **Azure Developer CLI**: **Install azd** is available before a Foundry project is selected.

## Version 1.0.7

This release makes sign-in and action availability more consistent, refreshes automatically deployed agents, and improves Agent Inspector conversations.

### Changed

- **Sign-in**: Canvas now consistently uses Azure Developer CLI authentication.
- **Canvas actions**: Actions remain disabled until their prerequisites are met, with contextual explanations of their availability. Related: [#603](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/603) and [#604](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/604).
- **Packaging**: Canvas is now packaged from Skylight with its canonical Agent Inspector.
- **Telemetry**: Device identity, action, and operation-outcome tracking are more accurate.

### Fixed

- **Hosted Agent deployment**: **Test in Foundry Portal** now appears after Copilot creates and automatically deploys an agent. Related: [#678](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/678).
- **Agent Inspector**: The message input stays visible during long conversations. Related: [#679](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/679).
- **Authentication terminal**: Opening the sign-in terminal no longer produces confusing log messages.
- **Session startup**: Canvas no longer uses privileged session hooks that caused repeated `register hooks` messages. Related: [#682](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/682).

## Version 1.0.6

This release refines multi-agent workflows and improves agent selection, skill loading, and local inspection.

### Added

- **Telemetry**: Canvas now records usage telemetry.

### Changed

- **Agent selection**: Select the current Hosted Agent from the **Working on** bar or choose **New Agent** to start another agent. Related: [#595](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/595).
- **Deployment details**: Details stay hidden when the deployment section is collapsed.
- **Local execution**: `azd` commands now identify their execution environment as GitHub Copilot App. Related: [#610](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/610).
- **Packaging**: The browser client is now bundled for release.

### Fixed

- **Agent context**: New-agent state stays separate from the previously selected agent. The agent list refreshes after creation, Canvas actions retain the selected-agent context, and empty workspaces no longer receive irrelevant agent context.
- **Foundry skill**: Newly installed skills reload for agent creation. Related: [#644](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/644).
- **Local inspection**: Inspector operations now target the correct Canvas instance. The provider is released after inspection, and Inspector logging errors no longer crash it.

## Version 1.0.5

This release adds issue reporting, plugin-update notices, and multi-agent selection, while improving local startup and Foundry Portal navigation.

### Added

- **Issue reporting**: Report an issue directly from Canvas. Related: [#597](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/597).
- **Plugin updates**: A dismissible notice shows when a newer plugin version is available. Installation and updates remain managed by the host. Related: [#596](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/596).
- **Agent selection**: Choose which Hosted Agent to inspect locally or test in the Portal when a workspace contains multiple agents.

### Changed

- **Canvas tab**: The tab now includes a preview label. Related: [#606](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/606).

### Fixed

- **Local inspection**: The integrated terminal is activated before the agent starts so launch commands are not silently dropped. Related: [#594](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/594).
- **Skills navigation**: The Skills link now opens the correct Foundry Portal destination. Related: [#601](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/601).
- **Hosted Agent regions**: Region checks now match the documented supported regions and provide clearer unsupported-region feedback. Related: [#600](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-dev-tools/issues/600).
- **Canvas handoffs**: Action handoffs no longer reopen Canvas.
- **Agent selection**: The local Hosted Agent picker now loads correctly.

## Version 1.0.4

This release clarifies Canvas handoffs and makes deployed-agent details easier to access.

### Changed

- **Chat and Canvas workflows**: Requests use Canvas only when its capabilities are available and honor explicit instructions to use the CLI or skip Canvas.
- **Agent creation**: Canvas handoffs now provide clearer guidance for the **Start** workflow.
- **Hosted Agent deployment**: Deployed-agent details include an explicit Foundry Portal action.

## Version 1.0.3

This release aligns the plugin's name and description with the Microsoft Foundry Canvas experience.

### Changed

- **Plugin metadata**: The description and README title now use Microsoft Foundry Canvas branding and describe its skills and interactive Canvas experience.

This release improves agent creation and workspace refreshes, adds a Portal playground handoff, and introduces the Microsoft Foundry plugin name.

### Added

- **Hosted Agent deployment**: Open deployed Hosted Agents in the Foundry Portal playground.

### Changed

- **Agent creation**: Concrete creation prompts are preserved when Canvas opens and remain distinct from generated inspiration ideas. Creation-section transitions, feedback, and region warnings are clearer.

### Fixed

- **Workspace state**: Workspace detection is more reliable, and Canvas refreshes after agent creation and deployment.
- **Local inspection**: Agents now run from their discovered `azd` project directories.

## Version 1.0.1

This release corrects extension discovery in Copilot.

### Fixed

- **Plugin installation**: The directory layout now allows Copilot to discover and load the bundled extension.

## Version 1.0.0

This release introduces Foundry Agent Canvas as an external plugin for GitHub Copilot App.
